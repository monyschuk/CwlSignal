# App scenario, part 2

> **This playground requires the CwlSignal.framework built by the CwlSignal_macOS scheme.** If you're seeing the error: "no such module 'CwlSignal'" follow the Build Instructions on the [Introduction](Introduction) page.

## Dynamic view properties

This page creates and maintains a view with an "Add to favorites" button that is enabled if (and only if) both of the following are true:

1. the user is logged in
2. the file selection is non-empty

The login status and the number of selected files are also displayed in the view as a checkbox and a text label. Neither of these are "real" (they cycle through states on a timer) but they should allow you to see how everything is connected and updated.

The most important part of the code are the three "dynamic properties" at the bottom of the `loadView` function. These take data provided by incoming signals and apply the result to the views.

## Using the Assistant View

To display the "view" for this playgrounds page, you should enable the Playgrounds "Timeline" Assistant View. To do this,

1. Make sure you can see Assistant Editor (from the menubar: "View" → "Assistant Editor" → "Show Assistant Editor").
2. Use the toolbar at the top of the Assistant Editor to select "Timeline" (the popup you need is to the right of the "< >" arrows but to the left of the filename/filepath.

After the page has run, you should be able to use the "timeline" slider to move forwards and backwards in time and see how the view state changed in response to the two state values.
