# App scenario 1

> **This playground requires the CwlSignal.framework built by the CwlSignal_macOS scheme.** If you're seeing the error: "no such module 'CwlSignal'" follow the Build Instructions on the [Introduction](Introduction) page.

## A threadsafe, notifying key-value storage

The following is a threadsafe dictionary of values. You might use something similar for the "model" in a trivial app. Even if more sophisticated storage than a dictionary is required, the pattern of updating and notifying will likely be the same.

1. The same work is involved in accessing a value once or subscribing properly so good behavior is encouraged.
2. If separate handling of initial value and subsequent values is required (e.g. using a `capture` and `subscribe` sequence as described in the previous article) the stream is correctly paused so you can't miss a notification.
3. Everything is threadsafe (the `map` closure will never be concurrently invoked and re-entrancy is not possible)
4. All changes go through the `map` function and can be coordinated there.
5. A `SignalError.cancelled` message is automatically sent to subscribers if `input` is released.
