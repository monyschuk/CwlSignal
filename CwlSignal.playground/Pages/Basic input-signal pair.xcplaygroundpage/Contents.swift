# Basic input-signal pair

> **This playground requires the CwlSignal.framework built by the CwlSignal_macOS scheme.** If you're seeing the error: "no such module 'CwlSignal'" follow the Build Instructions on the [Introduction](Introduction) page.

## The create function

The CwlSignal library is centered around one-way communication channels built from the `Signal` type (and a few related friends). The input to a channel is usually a `SignalInput`, then there's a number of `Signal` stages in the middle to transform and process the data moving through the pipeline and then the pipeline ends with a `SignalEndpoint`.

The data moving through the pipeline are `Result<Value>` instances. This means that they may be *values* –`Result.success(Value)` – or they may be *errors* – `Result.failure(Error)`. In general, *expected* errors are instances of `SignalComplete` (indicating signal `.closed` or sender `.cancelled`) and any other kind of error is indicates an *unexpected* error. In either case, a signal pipeline will send no further values after the first error is received.

The `(SignalInput, Signal)` pair returned from `create` lets you start building a channel from the initial input and the first intermediate `Signal`.

The `subscribe` function creates a `SignalEndpoint` which allows us to extract values from the channel. An endpoint isn't just a point to extract signal values; it also maintains the lifetime of the channel. The signal only becomes "active" (ready for receiving values) when a `SignalEndpoint` is connected. When all endpoints are released, the channel will be closed and all resources cleaned up.

let (input, signal) = Signal<Int>.create()

// Subscribe to listen to the values output by the signal.
// A signal pipeline will remain active while there is an endpoint listening.
let endpoint = signal.subscribe { result in
	switch result {
	case .success(let v): print("Value received: \(v)")
	case .failure(let e): print("Error received: \(e)")
	}
}

// Send values to the input end
input.send(value: 1)
input.send(value: 2)
input.send(value: 4)

// This `close` function is the same as calling `input.send(error: SignalComplete.closed)`
input.close()
