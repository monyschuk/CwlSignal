## The `combine` function

Another strength of reactive programming is the ability to integrate dependencies from different sources in a thread-safe manner.

CwlSignal offers the `combine` operator which has an interface close to that of the `transform` operator, except that incoming `Result`s are wrapped in an `EitherResult`, reflecting an origin from "either" the first, the second or possibly third, fourth or fifth different input `Signal`.
