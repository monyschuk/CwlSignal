# Serial pipelines 4: asynchrony

> **This playground requires the CwlSignal.framework built by the CwlSignal_macOS scheme.** If you're seeing the error: "no such module 'CwlSignal'" follow the Build Instructions on the [Introduction](Introduction) page.

## Using the `context` parameter.

Most functions in CwlSignal that accept a closure or other processing function will also take a `context` parameter immediately before the closure. This `context` specifies the execution context where the closure or function should run.

By default, this `context` is `.direct` (specifying that the closure should be directly invoked like a regular function) but you can specify an asynchronous context (like one of the Dispatch global concurrent queues or a private queue) to have the signal processed asychronously. In this way, reactive programming can snake across multiple contexts, multiple threads and multiple delays over time.

> `Signal` will ensure that values sent through the channel are delivered in-order, even if the context is concurrent.

// In reactive programming, blocking is normally "bad" but we need to block or the playground will finish before the background work.
semaphore.wait()

// We normally store endpoints in a parent. Without a parent, this `cancel` lets Swift consider the variable "used".
