# Serial pipelines 2

> **This playground requires the CwlSignal.framework built by the CwlSignal_macOS scheme.** If you're seeing the error: "no such module 'CwlSignal'" follow the Build Instructions on the [Introduction](Introduction) page.

## The `map` function. Also, transferring between contexts.

Most functions in CwlSignal accept a closure or other processing function will also take a `context` parameter that specifies the execution context where the closure or function should run. This includes `subscribe` and `transform` as well as other functions built on top of these.

As an example, the following code snippet uses `context` parameters in conjunction with the `map` function (a simplified one-to-one value transformer built on top of `transform`) to demonstrate sending a value in from the current context to the `.default` priority `Dispatch` global concurrent queue, before finally returning to the `.main` thread to report results.

let endpoint = output.map(context: .default) { value in

	return sqrt(Double(value))
}.subscribe(context: .asyncQueue()) { result in
	// Deliver to a completion thread.
	switch result {
	case .success(let value): print(value)
	case .failure: semaphore.signal()
	}

// Send values to the input end
input.send(value: 1)
input.send(value: 2)
input.send(value: 3)
input.close()

// In reactive programming, blocking is normally "bad" but we need to block or the playground will finish before the background work.
semaphore.wait()

// We normally store endpoints in a parent. Without a parent, this `cancel` lets Swift consider the variable "used".
